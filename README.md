# soc_siem_lab
In this project, we set up a basic home SOC in Azure from scratch. Using a Azure subscription, we walk through creating a virtual machine (VM), opening it to the internet as a honeypot, and forwarding logs to a central repository. We then integrate Microsoft Sentinel to analyze real-world attack data.
